2. COMPILING FLEXTABLE PACKAGE
----------------------------

To compile the FlexTable library, execute:

    make

from your FlexTable checkout directory.
It will generate a shared library in this location (by default)

    ./lib/flextable_package.so

By default, the Flex Avro Parser is not compiled. This parser depends on the Boost C++ library, which is not included in the FlexTable source code bundle.

Compiling Flex Avro Parser
----------------------------

Download the C++ Boost library version 1.50.0 from their website at www.boost.org; please download the archive with extension '.tar.gz'. The Avro parser has been tested with that version, but it may also work with later versions.

Copy the downloaded file to this location:
./third-party/boost/boost_1_50_0.tar.gz

Then, compile the FlexTable library once more

    make

The shared library now should include the Flex Avro parser.


----------------------------
3. TESTING FLEXTABLE PACKAGE
----------------------------

After compiling the FlexTable library, you can test it by executing this command from your checkout directory.

    make flex_test

The test creates a subset of Flex functions to load and query semi-structured data. You need to be a superuser in order to run the FlexTable tests as it creates a library and functions in your database.


----------------------------
4. FLEX VMAP API USAGE
----------------------------

To use the VMap API, include this header file

    src/VMap.h

in your code, and make sure that VMap.cpp is compiled along with the rest of your source files.


----------------------------
5. GENERATING DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------

We use DOxygen, an automatic documentation generator from source code, to create documentation in HTML format. To generate the documentation, execute this command from your checkout directory.

    make doc

This command creates HTML documentation at:
    doc/html/index.htm
